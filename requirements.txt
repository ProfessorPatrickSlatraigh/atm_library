# ATM Simulation Library Requirements

# This file lists all the dependencies required to run the ATM Simulation Library.
# As of now, the library uses only the Python Standard Library, hence there are no external dependencies.
# This library is compatible with Python 3.6 and later.

# Standard Library (No action required):
# - No external dependencies are required as the library uses only the Python Standard Library.

# Future Dependencies
# In future updates, if there are any external libraries required, they will be listed here.
# For example, if we decide to add database support or a web interface, relevant packages will be added.
# Examples (uncomment if needed in future updates):
# sqlalchemy==1.3.19
# Flask==1.1.2

# It's always a good practice to work in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages.
# You can create a virtual environment in Python using:
# python -m venv venv

# After activating the virtual environment, you can install the required packages using:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
