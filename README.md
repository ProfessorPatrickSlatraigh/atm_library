# atm_library
Library of simple ATM (cash machine) objects for practice exercises 

# Overview
Welcome to the ATM Simulation Library! This Python library is designed to simulate basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system. It's an educational tool aimed at helping students and beginners in programming to understand and practice object-oriented programming concepts, particularly in Python. The library includes simple yet illustrative examples of classes and methods that represent various components of an ATM system, such as accounts, ATM interactions, and a banking system.

# Features
Account Management: The Account class allows for basic operations like checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing funds.
ATM Operations: The ATM class simulates an ATM machine, handling user authentication and transaction processes.
Bank System Integration: The BankSystem class acts as a central system managing all accounts and their authentications.

# Getting Started
To use this library:

Clone the repository or download the source code from GitHub.
If there are any dependencies listed in requirements.txt, install them using pip install -r requirements.txt. Currently, this project does not require any external dependencies beyond Python's standard library.
Import the classes from the library in your Python script to simulate different ATM functionalities.  

Feel free to explore the code, modify it, and use it as a base for more complex simulations. This project is open for enhancements, and we encourage contributions and suggestions to improve it.
